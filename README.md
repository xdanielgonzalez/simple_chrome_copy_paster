# simple_chrome_copy_paster
>Chrome extension with a html demo file to demo it can copy and paste text into different fields. A proof of concept for another program I would like to make


This is a zip file of an unpacked chrome extension

1. To use this program download the file and unzip the chrome_copy_paster.zip file onto your computer

2. Navigate to manage extensions on the chrome browser and ensure that developer mode is turned on

3. Click on the load unpacked button

4. In the folder navigation menu select the **folder** titled **"chrome_copy_paster"**

5. The extension should automatically be installed

6. To use the extension please use the **demo_page.html** file in the folder titled **"chrome_copy_paster"**

(the extension is looking for fields that currently only exist on that page)

Then follow the instructions on the demo page (:
